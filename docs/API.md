# LIMA API Reference

NOTE: this document changes a lot. So it's likely that this doesn't reflect reality. Use openapi files for that.

Base URL: `/`  
All endpoints use JSON unless stated otherwise.  
No authentication required.

## Conventions

### Identifiers
- All primary identifiers are UUID v4 strings
- Folder paths are stored relative to the library root.

### Standard error format
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "string",
    "message": "human readable message",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

### Pagination
Cursor-based pagination parameters:
- `limit`: integer
- `cursor`: opaque string

Paginated response envelope:
```json
{
  "items": [],
  "next_cursor": "string or null"
}
```

### Authentication

Nothing. We may add API tokens in the future from a hard-coded list.
